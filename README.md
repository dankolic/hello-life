# hello-life
hello-world but with read-me

Does the #symbol make things bigger? 
I look upon the good old days when it represented a comment, akin to the '//' or '/**/' 
or even '/***/' as is often missused today

Consider this not the ramblings of a pseudo-intelligent, quasi-sentient being, but the sombre thoughts of an
ex-fundamentalist making adjustments for the sole purpose of adapting to the lax attitude of todays Laissez-faire generation.

Seriously, i'm just spinning words to complete this ReadME issue.
